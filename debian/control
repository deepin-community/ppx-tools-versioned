Description: tools for authors of OCaml syntactic tools
 This package includes tools for authors of syntactic tools (such as
 ppx rewriters):
  * ppx_metaquot: a ppx filter to help writing programs which
    manipulate the Parsetree, by allowing the programmer to use
    concrete syntax for expressions creating Parsetree fragments and
    patterns deconstructing Parsetree fragments;
  * rewriter: a utility to help testing ppx rewriters that runs the
    rewriter on user-provided code and returns the result;
  * Ast_mapper_class: a generic mapper from Parsetree to Parsetree
    implementing a deep identity copy, which can be customized with a
    custom behavior for each syntactic category;
  * dumpast: parses fragments of OCaml code (or entire source files)
    and dump the resulting internal Parsetree representation;
  * genlifter: generates a virtual "lifter" class for one or several
    OCaml type constructors.
